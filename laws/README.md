## The Position of Captain
### Choosing of Captains
Captains will be chosen by the Chronovail community at large, however SaggingRufus and McCalamity3 reserve the right to appoint or remove a captain at any time across all timelines.

### Length of Term
A Captain's term in Chronovail is 1 era. An era must begin at the start of the year, and finishes at the end of the year.

### Subsequent Terms
A Captain may serve multiple terms in Chronovail-Prime (CPO), as long as they are not served consecutively. Meaning If John is captain for year 5500, he is not eligible to be captain for the year of 5501. If John wishes to be the captain again, they may reign no earlier than the year 5502.

**Note:** The requirements of subsequent terms may vary between timelines

## Reporting Requirements
During their reign, a captain has several reporting requirements that they must fulfill in order to make a contribution to Chronovail. Reports and Logs are submitted via the appropriate discord channel

### Initial Report
Before assuming control of Chronovail, the captain must publish a report that defines their goals and aspirations as captain before the term begins. Captains are under no obligation to follow through on anything in their initial report, this simply serves a tool to help document the history of the various eras in Chronovail. The Captains initial report must also feature a list of all colonist.

Provide any screenshots, gifs, videos or any media you wish to this report. There is no requirement, but having the content visually is a nice touch.

### Captain's Logs
In addition to the initial report, each Captain must produce a minimum of one Captain's Log every 15 days (once per quarter). A captain may submit more than the minimum reports should they desire. There is no maximum 

A quarterly Captain's Log entry should detail the captain's current plans and progress on any long term projects currently in flight. The Captain should also detail any important events that happen during their reign. The Captains should include as much as detail as they can when making a log entry. Entries should include more than just text. The Captain should attempt to include screenshots, gifs, or even videos footage of what has taken place during their reign, to include as evidence for their report. 

**Note:** It is likely easiest to just record your game play (no camera, no mic required) and just take stills and clips from that to fill out your captain's log. Other wise you'll be pausing the game to open snipping tools or some other program.

### End of Era Reporting
At the end of an Era, the captain must submit an overall report of their time as captain of Chronovail. The Captain should reflect on their time as ruler. What went well, what did not go well, what would they like to say to future Captains. The end of era report must also feature a list of all colonist.

Provide any screenshots, gifs, videos or any media you wish to this report. There is no requirement, but having the content visually is a nice touch.
